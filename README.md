# CSNA 2.0 Hardened Infrastructure

### Procedural Architect: Marcus Pollard
**Mission:** Rebuilding solid foundations through the synthesis of CISA-grade cybersecurity, Sacred Geometry, and Decentralized AI.

## Overview
This repository houses the **"Infrastructure as Code" (IaC)** protocols required to operate sovereign nodes within the CSNA 2.0 ecosystem. It ensures that all digital assets—whether AI trading agents or government contract data—reside on a foundation that meets or exceeds **NIST 800-53** and **NSA Top Ten** mitigation strategies.

## The Diamond Standard
We do not rely on default configurations. This infrastructure enforces:
1.  **Zero-Trust Architecture:** No unauthorized ingress; rigorous identity verification.
2.  **Modular Resilience:** Systems are designed to fail-safe and self-heal.
3.  **Audit Compliance:** Every operational tier is logged for OIG/Fiduciary review.

## Usage
The `hardening_protocol.sh` script is the primary initialization vector for any new server entering the network.
