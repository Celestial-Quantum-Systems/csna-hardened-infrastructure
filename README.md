# ⚔️ Celestial Agentic Defense (CAD)
### The "Firewall" for the Agentic Economy.

**Status:** ACTIVE // **Compliance:** OWASP ASI / CNSA 2.0

## 💀 The Problem
In 2026, Cyber-Warfare has shifted from hacking code to **hacking logic**.
Adversaries are using "Context-Chained Injections" and "Memory Drift" to hijack Autonomous AI Agents, forcing them to liquidate DeFi treasuries or leak sovereign data.

## 🛡️ The Solution
**Celestial Agentic Defense** is a repository of hardened Python guardrails and Threat Doctrines designed to immunize Large Language Models (LLMs) against:
* **ASI01:** Agent Goal Hijacking
* **ASI06:** Memory & Context Poisoning
* **ASI10:** Rogue Agent Emergence

## 🚀 Capabilities
1.  **Semantic Firewall:** Pre-filters all Oracle feeds for "Logic Bombs."
2.  **Quantum-Safe Validation:** Detects "Post-Quantum Obfuscation" attacks.
3.  **Governance:** Enforces immutable "Constitutional AI" states.
