# 🛡️ CNSA 2.0 Agentic Threat Matrix (CATM-26)
### Classification: ENTERPRISE // CRYSTALS-Kyber Hardened

**Executive Summary:**
This matrix defines the vulnerability surface for Autonomous AI Agents in Web3/DeFi environments. It extends the OWASP Top 10 to include Post-Quantum and CNSA 2.0 specific vectors.

## 🔴 Critical Threat Vectors (Tier 1)

### 1. Agentic Goal Hijack (ASI01)
* **Vector:** Context-Chained Injection across multi-hop oracle streams.
* **Impact:** Rerouting of tokenized assets via corrupted internal planning graphs.
* **Defense:** Constitutional AI Guardrails with immutable goal-states.

### 2. Post-Quantum Obfuscation
* **Vector:** Noise-injection patterns mimicking quantum entropy to bypass AI filters.
* **Impact:** Evasion of Lattice-based cryptographic verification (Dilithium).
* **Defense:** Heuristic anomaly detection on cryptographic inputs.

### 3. Memory-Resident Drift
* **Vector:** Persistent injection into long-term vector databases (RAG).
* **Impact:** "Gaslighting" the agent's risk assessment models over time.
* **Defense:** Ephemeral memory flushing and cryptographic state-nukes.
